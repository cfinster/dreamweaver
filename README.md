Sublime Text 3 Dreamweaver Syntax Highlighting
===========

**This is a Sublime Text color scheme only. There are not UI styles.**

Are you so invested in Dreamweaver syntax highligting that you can't read any other code coloring? I am. These styles will get you close to what you were used to. Then perhaps you can start weaning yourself, as I am.

####Styled Languages

* HTML
* PHP
* Embedded PHP
* Javascript
* CSS
* XML

####Missing Styling/Improvements
